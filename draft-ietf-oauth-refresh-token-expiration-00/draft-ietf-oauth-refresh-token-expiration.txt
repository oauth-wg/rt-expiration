1.  Introduction

   RFC6749 defines the OAuth 2.0 protocol, part of which is the ability
   for a client to receive a refresh token that may be repeatedly
   exchanged for more access tokens.  OAuth 2.0 does not contain any
   normative language around expiration or lack thereof for refresh
   tokens, mentioning only that they are "typically long-lasting".

   In the years since the publication of OAuth 2.0, in response to
   changing security and privacy landscapes, many authorization servers
   have begun to issue shorter-lived refresh tokens for two main
   reasons:

   *  The authorization server or user may decide that the access being
      granted is too sensitive to allow indefinite access (e.g. mail or
      health data).

   *  The authorization server enforces a maximum duration that refresh
      tokens may be held without being exchanged on the token endpoint.

   Clients may wish to implement special handling for expiring refresh
   tokens.  For example, if the user has granted expiring access, the
   client may notify the user that they will need to reauthorize access
   before a certain date to avoid interruption of service.

2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   "Resource owner" and "user" may be used interchangeably to refer to
   the entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.

   "Client", "application", and "relying party" may be used
   interchangeably to refer to the application making protected resource
   requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.

4.  Concepts

   There are two mechanisms that can affect refresh token expiration.

4.1.  Authorization expiration

   When granting authorization for an application to access their data
   as referenced in [RFC6749] Sec 4.1.1, the user may opt to time-limit
   that authorization, especially if the data is sensitive or they
   aren't sure how long they'll continue using the application.  The
   authorization server itself may also impose mandatory limits on
   authorization duration.

4.2.  Refresh token timeout

   Authorization servers may wish to define a maximum amount of time
   clients can hold a refresh token without exchanging it.  Beyond the
   security benefit provided by expiring credentials, this also provides
   a convenient mechanism for authorization servers to ensure there
   aren't ancient valid credentials out in the wild, which could
   complicate tasks like refresh token key rotation.

5.  Refresh token expiration

   The refresh token MUST NOT expire later than the user authorization
   expires.  It MAY expire earlier if the authorization server also
   enforces a maximum duration between refresh token exchanges.

   If the user renews their authorization, the authorization server
   SHOULD update the expiration time of existing refresh tokens if their
   lifetime was truncated due to user authorization expiration.  The
   authorization server MUST NOT accept expired refresh tokens for any
   purpose, even if it has no way to update the expiration time of
   existing refresh tokens.

   Access tokens MUST NOT expire later than the user authorization
   expires.  If the user renews their authorization, the authorization
   server MAY update the expiration time of existing access tokens if
   possible.  Resource servers MUST NOT accept expired access tokens for
   any purpose, even if the authorization server has no way to update
   the expiration time of existing access tokens.

6.  Token endpoint response

   This specification introduces two new response parameters.

6.1.  Successful response

refresh_token_timeout
      The time in seconds that the refresh token may be held by the client
      without exchanging. For example, the value 604800 denotes that the
      refresh token will expire in one week from the time the response was
      generated. This value SHALL NOT exceed the value in
      authorization_expires_in.

authorization_expires_in
      The lifetime in seconds of the user's authorization for the scopes
      contained in the issued or presented refresh token. For example, the
      value 2629800 denotes that the authorization will expire in one month
      from the time the response was generated. This value MAY exceed that
      of refresh_token_timeout.

   If finite, the authorization server MUST return these values whenever
   the token endpoint response contains the refresh_token field.  The
   authorization server MAY return these values even if the response
   contains no refresh_token field in the response, which can be useful
   in the following example cases:

   *  For refresh_token_timeout, the authorization server could have
      updated the existing refresh token lifetime in place.

   *  For authorization_expires_in, the user's authorization lifetime
      could have been modified out of band.

   *  In all cases, it can be convenient for the client to receive these
      values in each response.

6.1.1.  Relationship of authorization_expires_in to scopes

   Though authorization_expires_in is returned from the token endpoint
   when refresh tokens are used, it corresponds to the user's
   authorization for _scopes_ (or finer-grained access through RAR
   [RFC9396]) rather than individual tokens.  The authorization server
   SHOULD ensure consistent lifetimes across multiple refresh tokens for
   the same scopes.

   Tying authorization lifetime to scopes means it's possible to have
   some access valid for one duration and other access valid for a
   different duration.  For example, a user could grant indefinite
   access for the openid scope and short-lived access for a calendar
   scope.

6.1.2.  Infinite Expiration

   Omitted values indicate that there is no fixed upper bound on the
   lifetime of the credential or authorization.  If the authorization
   server has not declared its support for refresh token lifetime in the
   Authorization Server Metadata, omitted response fields could indicate
   either indefinite validity or simply lack of support for this
   specification.  However, infinite expiration and lack of information
   about expiration should be handled by the client in the same way.
   That is to say, the client must always handle refresh token
   invalidation not caused by expiration, such as by explicit user
   revocation.

   Rather than omitting a response value, an authorization server may
   choose to return a large arbitrary value, e.g. 315569520 for 10
   years.  This avoids any ambiguity around support for infinite values
   while achieving a similar practical effect.  Clients MUST treat all
   large values as literals and MUST NOT make any assumptions about
   which may be considered infinite.

6.2.  Error response

   The existing invalid_grant error code already explicitly covers token
   expiration and should be sufficient.  Upon receiving this error code
   the client SHOULD start a new authorization grant flow.

6.3.  Example

   Suppose an authorization server enforces that refresh tokens must be
   exchanged at least once every 7 days, and a user has granted
   authorization to an application for access for 30 days.  The initial
   exchange will result in the following response values:

   refresh_token_timeout: 604800  // 7 days
   authorization_expires_in: 2592000  // 30 days

   An exchange 7 days after initial authorization will result in the
   following response values:

   refresh_token_timeout: 604800  // 7 days
   authorization_expires_in: 1987200  // 23 days

   An exchange 28 days after initial authorization will result in the
   following response values:

   refresh_token_timeout: 172800  // 2 days
   authorization_expires_in: 172800  // 2 days

7.  Update to Authorization Server Metadata

   Support for the expiring refresh tokens SHOULD be declared in the
   OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414] with the following
   metadata:

refresh_token_expiration_types_supported
    OPTIONAL. JSON array of supported expiration types. The possible values
    are "authorization" and "credential".

   If the authorization server omits expiration time response fields to
   indicate indefinite validity, it MUST declare
   refresh_token_expiration_types_supported in its metadata to indicate
   to the client that it's aware of this spec.

8.  User Experience Considerations

   While clients must be able to gracefully handle tokens' expiring at
   any time, the user experience may suffer if there's an unintended
   interruption of service.  This degradation of experience would most
   likely be felt by users of clients running in the background, such as
   task or travel management apps that rely on access to a user's
   calendar or inbox.

   If an application recognizes that its access is nearing expiration,
   it can proactively prompt the user for reauthorization next time
   they're "in the loop" (e.g. using a parameter like prompt=consent
   from [OpenID]), or even communicate to the user out of band that
   their granted access is expiring.

9.  Security Considerations

   While it is possible to allow refresh token expiration to exceed that
   of user authorization expiration if the authorization server checks
   both timestamps when validating a refresh token, this is a
   potentially dangerous source of bugs in systems with complicated user
   authorization models.  By requiring refresh tokens to expire no later
   than user authorization expires, there is less risk of bugs that
   accidentally provide data access to the client beyond the term of the
   user's authorization.

   Authorization servers implementing token rotation on every refresh
   [OAuth 2.1 Sec 4.3.1] may wish to enforce a maximum duration that a
   refresh token may be held without rotation, and this specification
   allows that duration to be communicated as part of the API rather
   than relying on documentation.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   Allowing users to time-limit their authorization is a privacy
   improvement.  While this was already doable in regular OAuth
   implementations, the potential interruption of service for the user
   may have discouraged implementation of the feature.  This
   specification provides a standardized way to mitigate that concern
   and should lead to greater adoption of time-limited authorization.

11.  IANA Considerations

   definitions in the IANA OAuth Parameters registry.
